# Get-Genotyping-Calls-for-CNVs
Helped a grad student in my lab with a data processing problem he had regarding CNV genotyping calls for 4444 CNVs spread across 96 samples.

Needed to count the occurence of different genotyping calls (-1, 0, 1, 2) for each CNV and enxure that it is coming from the correct sample and that it is interrogating the probes between the start and the end position of the CNV. 

I did not include the data as it is apart of his masters thesis and i do not want to share private information.
